# sebadmin
Admin panel for SEB (code_exp 2022 submission)
This demo is a very hacky Next.js application that pulls some data from our Firebase database as PoC.

# setup
Get a valid Firebase login JSON object thingy, then set that up as `firebase_config`.
This app expects several Firestore data structures; we have not documented them because we don't have time.

To run this app, 

```npm install```

then 

```npm run dev```

# Deployment
